2022-03-28
time spent: 0.5

DISCO:
        The distinciton between getNext and getCargo is important, paired in most case
        _dummy is very useful
        classes can exist inside other classes
QCC
        should we use this class in class setup in the future?

log

Was able to fill in the methods of our private nested class MyIterator during class, making use of the _dummy, getNext(), getCargo, 
get/setPrev() Methods to traverse. at home we completed the remove() method by setting the _dummy's previous to skip over one getPrev()
 as well as updating _okToRemove to false after removing.
