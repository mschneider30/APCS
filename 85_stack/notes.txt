HW85 -- Leon Leonwood Stack/Stacks/makes the stack work through linked and array lists
2022-03-30
time spent: 0.2 hrs

DISCO: code is identical except for initializations
       remains efficient with Big O(1)

QCC: is one better than the other


Started with Array List and got it to work pretty fast, only some errors with initializatipn

Once we finished that code we copied it over for linked list, changed the names from ArrayList<Integer>
to LinkedList<Integer>, and found that the exact same code worked

Our main method tests pushing thirteen numbers and then popping them, while peeking,
the updates each time
