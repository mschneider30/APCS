2022-05-11
time spent: 2

DISCO 
   - Its a lot of code
   - removing a node with two kids is significantly harder than one with two kids
   - there are a lot of scenarios, 
   - we have to have double of each code for both a left and right scenario

QCC:
   - how to remove root without parent of root
   - how would we make this shorter
