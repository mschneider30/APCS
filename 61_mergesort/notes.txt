DISCO:
It is very hard to make a group follow a set of instructions
People can be abrasive
Working together may be hard, but it is very effective

QCCs:
*Is this really the best way?
* How is this applicable to java
*Would it not be better to stop at like 5-6 cards instead of 2
*What happens if someone gets 3 cards?

THINKER FIRMWARE:
*if given multiple cards, split and give to People
*if given one card, give it back
*when cards are returned, merge sort
*give merged cards back up chain
