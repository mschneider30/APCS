APCS
HW61: Instructions so Simple...
2/8/2022
Time Spent: .4 hrs

DISCO:
* When copying the second deck from the original input array it is helpful to have a splitIndex variable that represents where the deck was split.
* It is very hard to make a group follow a set of instructions.
* People can be abrasive.
* Working together may be hard, but it is very effective

QCCs:
* Is this really the best way?
* How is this applicable to java?
* Would it not be better to stop at like 5-6 cards instead of 2?
* What happens if someone gets 3 cards?
  -Split into two unequal decks and pass to other thinkeren

THINKER FIRMWARE:
* If given one card, give it back.
* Otherwise, split the deck in two and pass it to two other thinkeren.
* If you receive two sorted decks, merge them.
* To merge, look at the top card of both decks, put the lower card face up in a new pile. Continue until you have one sorted deck.
