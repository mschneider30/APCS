/***
 * class GuessNumber -- fun fun fun!
 *
 * SKELETON
 *
 * eg, sample interaction with end user:
 *
 * Guess a # fr 1-100: 50
 * Too high
 * Guess a # fr 1-49: 25
 * Too low
 * Guess a # fr 26-49: 38
 * Correct! It took 3 guesses

/***
    DISCO:
    The break keyword exits a loop.
    The return keyword exits a method invocation.

    QCC:
    No unresolved questions.
