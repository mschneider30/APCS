Disco:
* Recursion Recursion Recursion
* Treating left and right as subtrees unlocks lots of functionality
* New way of generating subtrees

QCC:
* What is the point of generating a tree the way we did it?
* When can we generate a tree based on traversals?


 L = level  d = depth  h = height
q1) a perfect binary tree has 2^h -1 nodes
q2) at each level a perfect binary tree has 2^d nodes
q3)height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is log(base 2)n ceiling
