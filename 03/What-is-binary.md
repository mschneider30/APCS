2. Start at the right and assign place values as powers of 2 (2^0, 2^1, 2^2, etc.) Then multiply each 2^x by its corresponding value in base 2, then the sum of the products is the value of the numbe in base 10.
### Decimal -> Binary
3. First, take the decimal number and divide it by two. Next, assign the remainder as the rightmost digit of the base two number. Divide the quotient by two and assign the remainder as the next digit to the left. Continue this process until the quotient is zero.
