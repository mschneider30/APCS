time spent: 2.0 hrs

DISCO:
*Interesting applications of histograms
*Helpful to have methods like max to increase efficiency later on
*Histogram is easy when you use the idea of a multiplier (The ratio of the highest value to the longest bar) to determine how many asterisks to print
*Having an instance variable like _frequency opens up a lot of statistical possibilities.
*You have to check to ensure not first or last in isLocalMode

QCC:
*why did we use the Integer class
*is there a cleaner way to list the requirement to be a localMode
