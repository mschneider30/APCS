DISCO:
You don't actually need a constructor. The default one is very effective
Variables should be private to ensure they don't accidently get changed in aanother instance
QCC:
Why is int randomly changing big numbers?
Q2: It must exist because we can call a new BankAccount without a constructor.
Q3: You could try calling the integer name, or run BankAccount(specific instance).greet(), when greet is a method that returns BankAccount.
